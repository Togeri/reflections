**When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**



When you're sharing your work with other people or several team members are working on the same project at the same time.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

Because there might be some experimental changes that shouldn´t be included in the master branch because they´re under testing.

Or maybe you want to add a new feature later on, and it´s almost done, but you wan´t to wait, for example. 

There are many reason, but we can group them in two main sections: Preventing Functionality Issues and Addresing Privacy and Future Projects properly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone command clones (copies) a repository into your local machine, without acknowledging the creator.

Branches are just divergent paths of the program´s main path, which is usually called master.

Forks works the same as clones but instead acknowledge the creator of the repository. This cloned repository remains only in GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

By having a copy of the last known state of the remote in your computer, you can keep track of all the changes carried by other people (or by yourself in GitHub) while you weren´t working on that program on your computer

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I guess sharing my code within another platform. 
But Git and GitHub are indeed really simple yet powerfull developers tools for collaboration, sharing and working.
